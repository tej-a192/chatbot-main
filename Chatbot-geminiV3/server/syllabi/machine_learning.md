# Machine Learning Syllabus

## Course Overview
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition.

## Topics Covered
*   Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
*   Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems).
*   Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).

## Prerequisites
*   Strong foundation in probability, linear algebra, and calculus.
*   Proficiency in Python programming.

## Recommended Texts
*   "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop
*   "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
